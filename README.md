# Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) -ITM (SLS) BARODA UNIVERSITY

Welcome to the official repository for the GDSC ITM (SLS) BARODA UNIVERSITY! This project is developed and maintained by the Google Developer Student Club at ITM (SLS) BARODA UNIVERSITY.

## About the Project
GDSC ITM (SLS) BARODA UNIVERSITY is a student-led initiative supported by Google developers that seeks students from any academic subject, undergraduate or graduate. We were successful in establishing GDSC for the first time on the ITM (SLS) BARODA UNIVERSITY. Our main purpose for the club is to improve the educational, social, and cultural environment by inviting students from all backgrounds to expand their technological knowledge, to improve relationships between students and local communities by providing solutions, and to expand technological diversity.

Through understanding, utilizing, and reflecting on technology, GDSC at ITM (SLS) BARODA UNIVERSITY will have an influence on and empower students. With the help of Google Developers, the GDSC will organize educational sessions, hands-on workshops, and student-community collaborative projects centered on the latest and greatest in technology through peer-to-peer learning environment. We will be hosting events and activities for all students throughout the academic year
